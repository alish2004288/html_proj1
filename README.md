First project using HTML to create structure of "The lttle Tacos shop" website.

“The Tacos Shop” is a static webpage created using HTML, designed to emulate an engaging virtual taco store. 
The website features a clean, responsive layout with sections showcasing About LTS, shop details, menu and the contact information. Key HTML tags such as header, nav, section, and footer provide structured content, while imgage, unordered list, and paragraph tags enhance visual and informational elements.
Features include an interactive menu, customer contact form, and a gallery of vibrant taco images.
Tacos, a popular Mexican dish, are highlighted through engaging descriptions and colorful visuals, offering users an enticing browsing experience.

By leveraging the power of HTML5, “The Little Tacos Shop” provides an engaging user experience that highlights the rich flavors and cultural significance of tacos, a beloved Mexican dish.
